# Decentralized Digital Asset Trading DApp on Ethereum

This project implements a decentralized application (DApp) on the Ethereum platform, allowing users to connect their wallets via MetaMask, deposit and withdraw cryptocurrency (ETH) through a smart contract.

## Description

This DApp allows users to:
- Connect their wallet via MetaMask.
- Deposit ETH to a smart contract.
- Withdraw ETH from the contract.
- Check their balance on the contract.

## Technologies

- **Ethereum** â€” blockchain for interacting with smart contracts.
- **MetaMask** â€” cryptocurrency wallet for browser integration.
- **Solidity** â€” programming language for smart contract development.
- **ethers.js** â€” library for interacting with Ethereum using JavaScript.
- **HTML/CSS** â€” for creating the user interface.

## Project Structure

### ðŸ“„ `index.html` - User Interface

The `index.html` file is responsible for rendering the user interface:
- Creates the basic HTML structure with a minimalistic design.
- Contains a "Connect Wallet" button to allow users to connect MetaMask.
- Displays the current balance in ETH for the connected wallet.
- Includes input fields and buttons for deposit and withdrawal operations.
- The CSS in the `<style>` section provides basic styling (light theme, neat buttons, margins, etc.).

### ðŸ“„ `app.js` - Ethereum Interaction Logic

The `app.js` file contains the logic to interact with Ethereum using **ethers.js**:
- **connectWallet()** â€” Connects MetaMask and sets up interaction with the blockchain.
- **getBalance()** â€” Retrieves the balance of the user's address on the smart contract.
- **deposit()** â€” Allows the user to deposit ETH to the smart contract.
- **withdraw()** â€” Allows the user to withdraw ETH from the contract.
- Initializes the smart contract with ABI and address when the page loads.

### ðŸ“„ `DigitalAssetTrader.sol` - Smart Contract

The smart contract is written in Solidity and provides the core functionality for deposits and withdrawals:
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract DigitalAssetTrader {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
    }
}


## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ethereum-dapp.git
cd ethereum-dapp
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Ensure that you have **Node.js** installed, then run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Local Server

To run the DApp locally, use the following command:

```bash
npx http-server .
```

Your application will be available at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Usage

### 1. Connect Wallet

Click the "Connect Wallet" button to connect your MetaMask wallet to the Ethereum network.

### 2. Deposit ETH

Enter the amount of ETH you want to deposit into the contract and click the "Deposit" button. The amount will be transferred to the smart contract.

### 3. Withdraw ETH

Enter the amount of ETH you want to withdraw and click the "Withdraw" button. The contract will send the specified amount of ETH to your wallet.

### 4. View Balance

The current balance of your account on the smart contract will be displayed automatically after each deposit or withdrawal.
